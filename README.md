# FOOD DELIVERY TIME PREDICTION

This project is a simple Machine Learning based Food Delivery Time Prediction system built using Python and Scikit-learn.

The model predicts the estimated delivery time in minutes based on order conditions such as distance, traffic level, and weather.

PROJECT TYPE
Supervised Learning
Regression Problem

FEATURES USED
Distance in kilometers
Traffic level
Weather condition

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Linear Regression

HOW IT WORKS
Data is prepared and cleaned
Features and target variables are separated
Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset
User inputs delivery conditions
Model predicts delivery time instantly

INPUT EXAMPLE
Distance = 10 km
Traffic Level = 3
Weather Level = 4

OUTPUT EXAMPLE
Predicted delivery time = 68.57 minutes


FUTURE IMPROVEMENT
Use real world dataset
Add Random Forest or XGBoost
Create web app using Streamlit
Integrate live traffic and weather APIs
